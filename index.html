                            Though this historic site was the winter retreat of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, it's clear that neither man was exactly
                             relaxing while staying here—the buildings and grounds are filled with evidence of their busy minds and hands. There's enough
                              here to keep visitors busy for a full day, from 20-plus acres of carefully tended gardens to Edison's Botanical Laboratory, 
                              the men's historic homes, and a 15,000-square-foot museum, complete with old cars and hundreds of photographs documenting the 
                              lives of these two extraordinary men.

                        <h4>Bonita Springs</h4>
                        <p> <strong><ul>Bonita Springs History</ul></strong>
                            Located about halfway between Fort Myers and Naples, Bonita Springs is a beachfront community along the southern Gulf Coast
                            of Florida that is perfect for dog lovers, fishing enthusiasts, and anyone looking to embrace outdoor activities.
                            Because it fits somewhere in between small-town community and booming tourist destination, Bonita Springs offers a unique hybrid 
                            of calm serenity and exciting amenities that ends up making it a perfect fit for many retiring boomers.
                            Bonita Springs was originally referred to as “Survey,” which is what the Army Corps of Engineers surveyors called the area while 
                            they were mapping out southern Florida back in the 1870s. Developers who made their way to town much later decided that
                            “Bonita Springs” would be a much better name for the town.
                            People began visiting Bonita Springs via the Fort Myers-Southern Railroad in the 1920s, but the big boom really happened following
                             the opening of Interstate 75. After that, the town grew right along with its population as it quickly evolved into the Bonita 
                             Springs you will find there today.

                        <h4>Naples</h4>
                        <p> <strong><ul>Paradise Coast’s</ul></strong> natural beauty as inspiration for artists throughout the ages, it’s no surprise that the area
                           is a haven for the arts. Immerse yourself in culture with music and theater shows, museum exhibits, historic sites and
                           art galleries – and let the No. 1 Small Art Town in America be your muse. Then, get to know the area's colorful and 
                           fascinating heritage. The Calusa Indians once called the region home, and later the Seminoles. Pioneer settlers built
                           cattle ranches, while others fished, farmed and hunted in the Ten Thousand Islands. In the 1920s, wealthy Northern and
                           Midwestern settlers vacationed on our white-sand beaches and fished. While Naples and Marco Island have seen tremendous
                            growth and development, communities such as Everglades City, Immokalee, Chokoloskee and Ochopee still offer glimpses into
                            the days of yesteryear.
